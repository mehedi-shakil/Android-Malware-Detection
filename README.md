Because of the rapid expansion of mobile
devices and the growing reliance on mobile applications, there has been an increase in Android malware
threats, necessitating the development of sophisticated
detection systems. This research proposes a technique
for detecting Android malware that makes use of several deep learning models. The goal is to provide an
accurate and dependable method for classifying mobile
applications as malicious or benign. To assure data
integrity, the Drebin dataset is preprocessed. RFECV
was employed to obtain the optimal features for deep
learning algorithms such as Bi-LSTM, Bi-GRU, and
1D CNN. The dataset was trained using the selected
features for each deep learning algorithm based on the
feature selection method. The ensemble technique,
employing a weighted average method, was utilised to
combine the predictions of the individual models. Extensive testing revealed that combining Bi-LSTM and
CNN in the ensemble technique achieves the greatest
accuracy of 98.99%. This combination highlights the
efficiency of combining various models strengths for
Android malware detection.
